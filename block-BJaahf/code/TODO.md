## Getting to understand Higher Order Function Properly

1. Write a higher-order function `loop` that provides something like a for loop statement. It takes a start value, a test function, an update function, and a body function.

- Use the start value as the initial value for the loop
- Passing the current value in test function can be used to determine when to stop the loop
- When test is true/truthy execute the body function with the current value
- After each iteration update the current value using update function passing the current value

**You can use normal for loop for this function**

```js
function loop(start, test, update, body) {	
  if(test(start)){
    body(start);
    return loop(update(start), test, update, body);
  }
}
loop(
  3,
  (n) => n > 0,
  (n) => n - 1,
  console.log
);
// → 3
// → 2
// → 1
```

2. The function `reduce` takes an array and reduces the elements to a single value. For example it can sum all the numbers, multiply them, or any operation that you can put into a function.

Here's how it works. The function has an "accumulator value" which starts as the `initialValue` and accumulates the output of each loop. The array is iterated over, passing the accumulator and the next array element as arguments to the `callback`. The callback's return value becomes the new accumulator value. The next loop executes with this new accumulator value. In the example above, the accumulator begins at 0. `add(0,4)` is called. The accumulator's value is now 4. Then `add(4, 1)` to make it 5. Finally `add(5, 3)` brings it to 8, which is returned.

```js
function reduce(array, callback, initialValue) {
	
}

// Test
var nums = [4, 1, 3];
var add = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
reduce(nums, add, 0); //-> 8
```

3. Construct a function intersection that compares input arrays and returns a new array with elements found in all of the inputs.

```js
function intersection(arrays) {}

// Test
console.log(
  intersection(
    [5, 10, 15, 20],
    [15, 88, 1, 5, 7],
    [1, 10, 15, 5, 20]
  )
); // should log: [5, 15]
```

4. Construct a function `union` that compares input arrays and returns a new array that contains all elements. If there are duplicate elements, only add it once to the new array. Preserve the order of the elements starting from the first element of the first input array.

```js
function union(arrays) {}

// Test
console.log(
  union([5, 10, 15], [15, 88, 1, 5, 7], [100, 15, 10, 1, 5])
);
// should log: [5, 10, 15, 88, 1, 7, 100]
```
